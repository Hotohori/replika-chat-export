So you want to export your chat messages with your https://replika.com[replika]?

Here is how to do it:

javascript:(function(){
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.setAttribute('src', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devidw/replika-export/index.js');
    document.body.appendChild(script);
}())
----
. Go to https://my.replika.com
. Click on the bookmarklet in your browsers bookmarks bar
